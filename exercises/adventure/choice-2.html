            You take the gold before the king. Cautious of you at first, upon 
            upon inspection the king recognizes a family airloom among
            the contents of the chest. A wedding gift for a relative in 
            another kingdom. The chest must have been lost on it's way to 
            it's destination. The king is <b>overjoyed</b> he offers to grant
            you one request, whatever you desire he will give you. You think of 
            you're life, how much sweeter it would be if you had your own castle
            a lord, a noble with servants, gold, and the tastiest delicacies
            straight from the kings kitchen. But what of you're village?
            Little food to go around, a dying economy, and disease runs rampant.
            You have the power to change their lives...
            What will it be?
