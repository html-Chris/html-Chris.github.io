            You take the gold for yourself and buy a palace on a hill 
            overlooking you're old village. Part of you feels pity for them, 
            that used to be you're life... but you've never tasted wines so 
            sweet, cheeses so sharp, bread so filling. You're curtains are fine
            silk, and every morning is a pleasure. Now that you have riches,
            the king would take notice of you, you could make a request on 
            behalf of your village and change their lives... but would he be 
            suspicious of you're sudden acsension? The king knows all the 
            nobles. What if he found out you stole the gold! You could be thrown
            in the jails or worse!
            What will it be?
