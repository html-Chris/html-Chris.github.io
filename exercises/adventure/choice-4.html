            You ignore you're conscience and keep living the sweet life. You're 
            village resents you and the king is none the wiser. You live a 
            long, vapid life filled with indulgence and empty pleasures. 
            <b>You die alone</b>, even as a noble no one will remember 
            you're name. But hey, wasn't that wine so sweet?
