            You ask the king to <b>save you're village</b>. He promises to do 
            all he can to better the lives of you're fellows and expresses 
            his deepestgratitude for returning his chest to him. You leave the 
            kings palace with no gold. But somehow, the air feels different, 
            lighter.And the sunshine is a little brighter today. 
            You're village hears of you're good deeds, and you live a long 
            life of purpose, family, and die surrounded by love. 
            You're name is remembered for generations as the young legend 
            who saved his people.
