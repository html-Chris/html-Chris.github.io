            <b>You tell the king of you're villages strife</b>, pleading on their 
            behalf for him to intervene. He hears you and is troubled by their
            suffering. He vows to help them and improve their lives... but 
            the king is no fool. He knows all the nobles and you have the look
            of a wolf in sheeps clothing, you're royal garb is mismatched and 
            poorly fit. A commoner dressed as a nobleman. He recognizes his 
            family heirloom wrapped around you're neck, a golden necklace you
            found to be particularly beautiful. You stole his gold! His 
            guards seize you and throw you in jail to await you're sentence. 
            His promise remains true, he will help you're village, and you will
            face the consequences of you're actions. You lay in you're cell, 
            unsure of you're fate, yet unburdened of guilt. You're village goes 
            on to thrive, the king is celebrated, and you die in you're cell...
            forgotten, you're name never uttered again. You saved you're 
            village.
