            <b>You invest all of you're riches into you're village</b>
            You lose you're palace, and all you're fine possessions returning to
            you're village with nothing but a crown. You're village meets you 
            with mixed reception. Some view you as a hero, who saved them from 
            poverty. Others remember you as a symbol of corrupting greed
            on the hill, you could have helped them sooner. As you settle back 
            into you're life as a peasant you keep the crown as a reminder of
            the lessons you've learned. You live the rest of you're life seeking
            redemption for you're past, making a name for yourself along the
            way. You are remembered as a noble, a betrayer, a generous 
            samaritan, and a hero. You're legend is shrouded in myth and changes
            based on who you ask. You die seeking redemption, never satisfied,
            never understood. You're myth is remembered, and you're village 
            saved.
