            <b>You are nobody</b>... stuck in the squalor of a nameless village, 
            destined to die with no one to mourn you. 
            <br>
            But what's this?  You've stumbled upon a chest in the wilderness.
            You don't know who this treasure belongs to, if it's even treasure. 
            Whatever is inside could be valuable! It could be your 
            chance to be great! Or it could make things worse for you...
            <br>
            What will it be?
