                <h3>STANDING ON TWO LEGS</h3>
                <p>
                    Halo is a franchise that revolutionized the first-person 
                    shooter genre of gaming, and raised the bar for what could 
                    be achieved with AI and video game story telling. An epic 
                    Sci-Fi military adventure that immortalized itself as an 
                    instant classic, with a cinema-worthy narrative. However, 
                    for all of Halo's strengths, somewhere along the way it 
                    lost something. Why do modern Halo games fall short of the 
                    original trilogies glory? And what makes Halo a franchise 
                    that  was strong enough to stand on it's own two legs?
                </p>
                <h3>COMBAT EVOLVED</h3>
                <p>
                    <b><i>Halo: Combat Evolved</i></b> was released in 
                    2001 for the original <b><i>Xbox</i></b> game console by 
                    <b><i>Microsoft</i></b>. Developed by 
                    <b><i>Bungie Studios</i></b> it was meant to be THE game 
                    that motivated consumers to buy an Xbox, and since it was 
                    recognized as a critical and commercial success, it did 
                    just that. Halo was an experimental title. Groundbreaking 
                    AI that followed predictable patterns with dynamic 
                    pathfinding and immersive reactions, seamless movement and 
                    combat mechanics, map design that compliments the gameplay 
                    loop, and an unforgettable ost. Halo wasn't just a "game" 
                    it was an experience, and it stood out from it's 
                    comtemporaries because it had story to tell. Created 
                    during a time where the only other first-person shooter 
                    with a story was 
                    <b><i>Half-Life</i></b> by <b><i>Valve</i></b>, 
                    Halo was further confirmation that gaming wasn't just a 
                    juvenile waste of time, but a legitmate art form.

                <h3>THREE BETRAYALS</h3>
                <p>
                    While the original trilogy and prequel are deserving of 
                    great praise, since the departure of the original game 
                    developers, many fans of this amazing franchise agree that 
                    the game has been in a crisis. Three Halo games have been 
                    released since the prequel game <i><b>Halo Reach</i></b>, 
                    and each of these games have severely missed the mark of 
                    what Halo is. Halo lived through a time where console gaming 
                    was young and still finding it's footing in the modern 
                    landscape. Games had smaller budgets and scale, which 
                    allowed gaming studios to experiment, innovate, and had 
                    very little restrictions placed upon them. Since 2001 the 
                    gaming industry has grown exponenentially and has become 
                    severely profitable, and while this has allowed for the 
                    creation of some truly amazing titles unlike anything we've 
                    ever since in the past, it has also fundamentally changed 
                    the way games are made. Due to change in leadership, a new 
                    development team, and the modern landscape of gaming... 
                    Halo has suffered a blow that it still has not recovered 
                    from. In an effort to compete with modern first-person 
                    shooters, <b><i>343 Industries</i></b> incorporated 
                    out-of-place gameplay mechanics that conflicted with Halo's 
                    core gameplay loop, drastically changed the artstyle in a 
                    way that was unfaithful to the original aesthetic Halo was 
                    known for, and meddled with the characters in a way that 
                    disrespected the legacy of the Halo games. In other words, 
                    Halo lost it's identity.

                <h3>TRUTH AND RECONCILLIATION</h3>
                <p>
                    Halo has been stumbling through this current generation of 
                    gaming, trying to find it's footing in a corporatized 
                    climate. Most have lost hope that it can ever be great 
                    again. It may never be... but Halo is more relevant now 
                    than ever before. Halo stands out as a reminder to the 
                    amazement and sense of wonder that gaming used to make us 
                    feel. The simplicity of turning on, and settling in to be 
                    taken on a journey through another world. A feeling that 
                    very few modern games can illicit. We may never have 
                    another great Halo game, but we can't forget what Halo 
                    represented. If modern day examples of consumers fighting 
                    back against corporate greed, like the Helldivers 2 mass 
                    review bomb that caused Sony to roll back on it's absurd 
                    PSN requirements teaches us anything, it's this... we're in 
                    a fight for the soul of gaming. We decide the future 
                    of this business with our money, time and voices. Like 
                    humanity in Halo... we are losing. But there is still time. 
                    To quote the Master Chief himself... it's time for us to 
                    start "finishing this fight".
