        <h5>DINNER | MAIN COURSE</h5>
        <h1>SPICY "VODKA" LENTIL PASTA</h1>
        <p>
            This recipe is a high fiber twist on the classic 
            spicy "vodka" pasta. The ultimate hack is blending red lentils 
            right into the sauce, which makes it thick, creamy, 
            and so much more nourishing. It’s cozy, cheesy, and 
            has just the right amount of heat, all with no vodka needed.

        <h1>INSTRUCTIONS</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>
             Add the rinsed lentils and chicken broth to a medium saucepan. 
             Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce to medium-low 
             and let the lentils simmer until tender and most of the broth is 
             absorbed. Once cooked, transfer the lentils and any remaining 
             liquid to a blender. Blend until completely smooth and creamy, 
             then set aside.   
            </li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>
                In a large pot of generously salted water, cook the pasta over 
                medium-high heat until just al dente. Before draining, 
                reserve 1/2 cup of the starchy pasta water. Drain the pasta and 
                set aside. You can do this step while you’re working on the 
                sauce to save time.
            </li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>
                In a large deep skillet or sauté pan, heat the olive oil and 
                butter over medium heat. Once the butter has melted and begins 
                to foam, add the onions and garlic. Sauté for about 
                3 to 4 minutes, stirring constantly, until the onions are soft, 
                fragrant, and lightly golden but not browned.
            </li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>
                Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, 
                stirring often, until it darkens in color and 
                caramelizes slightly to deepen the flavor.
            </li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>
                Add the lentil purée along with a splash of the reserved pasta 
                water to help it blend smoothly. Use an immersion blender 
                directly in the pan to blend until silky and cohesive — or 
                transfer to a high-speed blender if you don’t have one.
            </li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>
                Once smooth, slowly pour in the heavy cream while stirring to 
                combine. Reduce the heat to low-medium and whisk until the 
                sauce turns glossy and velvety.
            </li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>
                Once smooth, slowly pour in the heavy cream while stirring to 
                combine. Reduce the heat to low-medium and whisk until the 
                sauce turns glossy and velvety.
            </li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>
                Stir in the parmesan until it melts completely into the sauce. 
                Add more of the reserved pasta water as needed until the sauce 
                reaches your desired consistency — creamy and smooth but not 
                too thick. Season with salt and pepper to taste, then taste 
                again and adjust if needed.
            </li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>
                Add the cooked pasta directly into the pan with the sauce. 
                Toss over low heat until every piece of pasta is evenly coated 
                and glossy with the sauce.
            </li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>
                Plate the pasta and garnish with fresh parsley, 
                more parmesan, and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes. 
                Serve hot and enjoy!
